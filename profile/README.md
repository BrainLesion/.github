# BrainLesion 

>**BrainLesion or BrainLes** is a versatile toolkit for building modular brain lesion image analysis pipelines in Python. 
<br>It is designed for a smooth, **"brainless"** development experience, minimizing cognitive load and streamlining the creation of complex workflows. 

<br>
The toolkit offers a range of modules to support various tasks throughout the analysis workflow: 

### Modules 
[**Preprocessing**]( https://github.com/BrainLesion/preprocessing#brainles-preprocessing) 
<br>Adaptable preprocessing pipeline that performs co-registration, atlas registration, and optional skull-stripping and defacing on arbitrary multi-modal 3D brain MRI. 

[**BraTS**](https://github.com/BrainLesion/BraTS#brats)
<br>Top-performing algorithms from the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenges to synthesize missing modalities, inpaint lesions, and create tumor segmentations. It includes specific algorithms regarding various pathologies. 

[**AURORA**](https://github.com/BrainLesion/AURORA#aurora) 
<br>Deep learning models for brain cancer metastasis segmentation.

[**GlioMODA**](https://github.com/BrainLesion/GlioMODA#gliomoda)
<br>Robust adult glioma segmentation with varying input sequences.

[**PeTu**](https://github.com/BrainLesion/PeTu/tree/main#petu) 
<br>Pediatric brain tumor segmentation models. 

[**Panoptica**]( https://github.com/BrainLesion/panoptica#panoptica) 
<br> Tool for extracting, matching, and evaluating brain lesion instances from segmentation outputs.
